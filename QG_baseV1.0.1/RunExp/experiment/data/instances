my instructions said that i could install rosetta stone onto 2 computers .
hated it , couldn't get it to work with my bank account , feel like it was a complete waste of my time and money .
it is my understanding the roxio easy vhs to dvd for mac will work with any analog source . my submitted issue with roxio is that the product no longer provides the software needed to make dvds after the conversion from analog to digital . ( as advertised on web site and box )
this is a dvd .
i have windows 8 and it is working fine with the microsoft pgm .
rose's roses offers the complete student / teacher full version which includes installation disks for both mac and pc . brand new , sealed in box .
yes . i renewed my subscription with this .
yep-i did that twice with no problem , so i could work on taxes while at work pc and at home on my laptop : )
yes , it can be placed on a desk for dictation . for superior recording quality , speak clearly and have suitable sound-absorbing material stop sound from bouncing around your recording space .
yes . this equipment is used daily in our cafeteria with 100 + students , and we have used it in our elementary school gym when that pa system wasn't working . all you need is batteries ! it is a great little system .
no , it does not come with a microphone .
it does for me , but i do have a small volume boost from my pedal board . i promise you , it is the best $ 100 you will ever spend . i have two close friends who are incredible guitar players , and they both bought one , and they love it .
yes , if you fold it in a u shape , it should fit in a box that is 12 " x 12 " x 6 " . it will flatten out just fine afterward . i would not recommend storing it that however . - james
yes , it comes with a splitter with a microphone input and 1 / 4 " guitar / bass input .
its a soft side case , so it will protect from dust and dirt but , not from bumps and such .
yes from what i know of keyboards . it is about the same as our upright piano .
